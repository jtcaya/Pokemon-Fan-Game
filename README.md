This is my currently untitled Pokemon fan game made entirely in Godot!

Many thanks to: 

Kiy, usigusom, ASM, and 黒インク for the party screen design,

Arkeve for the base functionality tutorial, Chris Courses for the base textures, and Jello Apocalypse for the original ideas.

All other textures and ideas are by the Pokemon Company and me.
